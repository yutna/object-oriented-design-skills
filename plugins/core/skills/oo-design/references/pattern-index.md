# Pattern index

This index lists the patterns this pack names, in alphabetical order, with
one sentence each and the skill that treats or names each. The names are
common vocabulary. Architecture styles are left to
[the layering skill][layering], and the catalogue in
[the choosing-a-pattern skill][choosing-pattern] groups the object
patterns by problem.

- **Abstract Factory.** Answers several products that vary together
  and must come from one family. [Choosing a pattern][choosing-pattern]
- **Active Record.** Answers a module whose classes mirror its tables
  and hold few rules, with an object that is one table row and saves
  itself. [Taming persistence][persistence]
- **Adapter.** Answers a port the domain owns by translating an
  outside system's interface into the messages the port declares.
  [Inverting dependencies][inverting]
- **Aggregate.** Answers which objects one rule must keep true at
  every change, around one root that every change goes through.
  [Designing aggregates][aggregates]
- **Anti-corruption Layer.** Answers a context that depends on a
  model it does not control, with one translator at its edge that
  turns the other model's terms into its own.
  [Bounding contexts][contexts]
- **Application Service.** Answers where one use case runs, as the object
  that loads aggregates, sends them commands, stores them and ends the
  transaction. [Placing domain logic][placing]
- **Bridge.** Answers two dimensions that vary independently, where
  one hierarchy would multiply the classes.
  [Choosing a pattern][choosing-pattern]
- **Builder.** Answers many optional parts assembled before the
  object exists, with the required parts known up front and one step
  that checks the whole. [Constructing valid objects][constructing]
- **Bulkhead.** Answers one slow dependency that would otherwise
  use every worker. [Choosing a pattern][choosing-pattern]
- **Chain of Responsibility.** Answers several handlers that may
  take a request in turn, with the set or order that varies.
  [Choosing a pattern][choosing-pattern]
- **Channel.** Answers a lab result leaving without the sender
  naming the lab. [Choosing a pattern][choosing-pattern]
- **Circuit Breaker.** Answers a dependency that keeps failing by
  stopping the calls and trying again later.
  [Choosing a pattern][choosing-pattern]
- **Command.** Answers an action that must be queued, stored, logged,
  undone or retried, so it stays an object that carries its data.
  [Patterns the language provides][language-patterns]
- **Command and Query Separation.** Answers whether a method changes
  state or returns an answer, keeping a command and a query apart.
  [Encapsulating state and behaviour][state-and-behaviour]
- **Competing Consumers.** Answers several workers taking from one
  reminder queue, where each message goes to one of them at a time.
  [Choosing a pattern][choosing-pattern]
- **Composite.** Answers a part and a whole of the same items that
  answer the same messages, so callers do not branch on the shape.
  [Choosing a pattern][choosing-pattern]
- **Composition Root.** Answers where the object graph is built and
  connected: one place at the program's edge.
  [Inverting dependencies][inverting]
- **Conformist.** Answers a context content to adopt another model,
  taking its words as they are with no translation of its own.
  [Bounding contexts][contexts]
- **Consumer-driven Contract.** Answers a contract where the
  reader's recorded expectations drive the tests the publisher keeps
  green. [Crossing system boundaries][crossing]
- **Context Map.** Answers which context depends on which and how
  they agree, written down for every pair that talks.
  [Bounding contexts][contexts]
- **Data Mapper.** Answers a class whose fields or rules part from
  its table, with a separate object that moves data between the
  domain and the store. [Taming persistence][persistence]
- **Data Transfer Object.** Answers data that crosses a process or
  layer boundary, carrying it as plain data with no business rules.
  [Deciding object or data][object-or-data]
- **Dead-letter Channel.** Answers a message no handler can
  process, by keeping it for a person.
  [Choosing a pattern][choosing-pattern]
- **Decorator.** Answers a step that wraps an object without
  changing the messages its callers send, while the combinations
  vary. [Choosing composition over inheritance][composition]
- **Domain Event.** Answers a change other parts must react to,
  named in the past tense and carrying the identities and facts its
  handlers need. [Publishing domain events][events]
- **Domain Model.** Answers rules that interact and grow, held in
  objects that carry both data and rules. [Placing domain logic][placing]
- **Domain Service.** Answers an operation no single aggregate can
  decide, in a stateless object named for the clinic activity it
  performs. [Placing domain logic][placing]
- **Entity.** Answers a concept with a history, identified by an
  identifier assigned once and compared by it.
  [Modeling values and entities][values]
- **Event Sourcing.** Answers an aggregate whose past states must be
  rebuilt exactly, by storing its events as the record of truth.

- **Flyweight.** Answers many objects that share a large immutable
  part while the varying part is small.

- **Idempotent Receiver.** Answers a repeated event, by having each
  handler check whether it has handled that event before it changes
  anything. [Publishing domain events][events]
- **Identity Map.** Answers two copies of one object in one
  transaction, by returning the object already loaded for that

  changes often, such as an eligibility expression or a reminder
  schedule. [Choosing a pattern][choosing-pattern]

  caller must not know, with the language's own iteration rather than
  a hand-written class.
