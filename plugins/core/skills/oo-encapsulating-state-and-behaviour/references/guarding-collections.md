A collection held by an object is part of its state. Callers may need to
read it, but reading is not the same as holding the list itself. These
examples use a clinician's working hours and a patient's allergy list.

## A read-only view

A clinic shows a clinician's working hours on several screens. The
screens only read the periods, so `WorkingHours.periods()` returns a
read-only view rather than the list.

```text
value WorkingPeriod
  - day: Weekday
  - opensAt: TimeOfDay
  - closesAt: TimeOfDay
  + new(day: Weekday, opensAt: TimeOfDay, closesAt: TimeOfDay)

class WorkingHours
  - periods: List<WorkingPeriod>
  + new(initialPeriods: List<WorkingPeriod>)
    raises OverlappingHours
    if initialPeriods.hasOverlap() then
      raise OverlappingHours
    else
      periods := initialPeriods.copy()
  + add(period: WorkingPeriod): void
    raises OverlappingHours
    if periods.anyOverlaps(period) then
      raise OverlappingHours
    else
      periods.add(period)
    return
  + periods(): ReadOnlyList<WorkingPeriod>
    return periods.readOnlyView()
```

`initialPeriods.hasOverlap()` is taken to mean true when two periods in
the list overlap. `initialPeriods.copy()` is taken to mean a new list
with the same periods, so a caller that later changes its own list does
not change the working hours. `periods.anyOverlaps(period)` is taken to
mean true when some period in the list overlaps the new one.
`periods.add(period)` appends to the clinician's own list once.
`periods.readOnlyView()` returns a `ReadOnlyList<WorkingPeriod>` that
readers cannot change. The constructor raises rather than store an
overlapping list, sets `periods` before any method reads it, and every
field is private.

## Methods that name the action

A patient's allergy list changes when a clinician records an allergy.
`record` checks the list before it adds, and `hasAllergy` answers a
question without changing anything.

```text
class Patient
  - allergies: List<Allergy>
  + new(initialAllergies: List<Allergy>)
    raises AllergyAlreadyRecorded
    if initialAllergies.hasDuplicates() then
      raise AllergyAlreadyRecorded
    else
      allergies := initialAllergies.copy()
  + record(allergy: Allergy): void
    raises AllergyAlreadyRecorded
    if allergies.contains(allergy) then
      raise AllergyAlreadyRecorded
    else
      allergies.add(allergy)
    return
  + hasAllergy(allergy: Allergy): Boolean
    return allergies.contains(allergy)
  + allergies(): ReadOnlyList<Allergy>
    return allergies.readOnlyView()
```

`initialAllergies.hasDuplicates()` is taken to mean true when two
allergies in the list are equal. `initialAllergies.copy()` is taken to
mean a new list with the same allergies, so the caller keeps no handle
on the stored list. `allergies.contains(allergy)` is taken to mean true
when the list holds an allergy equal to the new one.
`allergies.add(allergy)` appends once. `record` is a command and returns
nothing; `hasAllergy` and `allergies()` are queries and change nothing.
The constructor raises rather than store a duplicate, sets `allergies`
before either query reads it, and every field is private.

## Copy what crosses the boundary

A date is mutable in many languages: a caller that keeps the object it
passed in can change the day later. `DayOff` copies both dates in and
both dates out.

```text
value DayOff
  - startsOn: Date
  - endsOn: Date
  + new(start: Date, end: Date)
    startsOn := start.copy()
    endsOn := end.copy()
  + startsOn(): Date
    return startsOn.copy()
  + endsOn(): Date
    return endsOn.copy()
```

`start.copy()` and `end.copy()` are taken to mean new date values with
the same instant. The constructor copies both inputs before it stores
them, and each query returns a copy, so a caller that keeps either date
cannot change the stored value. The fields are private, and the
constructor sets both before either query reads them.

A read-only view is enough for a collection that callers only read. It
is not a mutable output, so it needs no copy. A copy is the safer answer
when the caller will keep the value or change it. Both stop the caller
from changing the state behind the object's back.
